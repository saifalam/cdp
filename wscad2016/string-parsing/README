Problem A
String Parsing

String Parsing is an important problem in Computer Science and the central algorithm
in the construction of compilers. It is the process of analyzing a string of symbols
conforming to the rules of a formal grammar.
A grammar mainly consists of a set of production rules for transforming strings of
symbols. To generate a string in the language described by the grammar, one begins
with a string consisting of only a single start symbol. The production rules are then
applied – in any order – until a string that does not contain neither the start symbol nor
designated non-terminal symbols is produced. The language generated by the grammar
consists of all distinct strings that can be generated in this manner.
