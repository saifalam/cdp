Problem B
Game of Life

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented by Cambridge mathematician John
Conway. It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules,
can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various
patterns throughout the course of the game. In this version of the game we have a square
board (2D array) where cells are updated in each timestep according to the following
rules:

For a space that is populated:
o Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
o Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
o Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.


For a space that is empty or unpopulated:
o Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
Figure B1 provides an example of the Game of Life in a 11×11 board. Empty cells and
populated cells are represented by light and dark gray squares, respectively. Pane (a)
shows the initial board and pane (h) shows the simulation result after 7 timesteps.

Input

The first line informs the board size and the number of steps (both integers), separated
by a white space. The following lines represent the cells of the initial board, where a
whitespace represent an empty cell and a “x” represent a populated one. Lines in the
board are separated by line breaks.
The input must be read from the standard input.

Output

The program will print the last board, i.e., the board after all timesteps, where a
whitespace represents an empty cell and a “x” represent a populated one. Lines in the
board are separated by line breaks.
The output must be written to the standard output.
